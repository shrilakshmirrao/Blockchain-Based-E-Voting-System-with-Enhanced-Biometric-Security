This final year project presents the creation of a secure and efficient online decentralized voting system that leverages the robustness of Blockchain Ethereum Technology and the precision of machine learning algorithms for user authentication. The system ensures a transparent, tamper-proof, and user- friendly voting process, through a web-hosted API which enables users to participate in elections from remote locations and eliminating the possibility of under-the-bench corruption.

There are mainly 2 modules:
    1) Authentication
    2) Voting


The three high level processes carried out by the system are:
    1) Two Step Verification:
        a) Facial recognition of the voter
        b) Verify Blockchain address
    2) Launching a new ballot (Cast Vote using Metamask wallet and perform transaction)
    3) Instantaneous display of election results

The system is built with the assumption that the voter has submitted all the necessary documents such as his identification card (e.g: Aadhaar), at least two days prior to the election day.

Technological Stack Used:
  Python Django Web Framework (Authentication website), 
  Ethereum Sepolia Test Network (Infura), 
  Ganache CLI (for testing), 
  Truffle Suite, 
  Metamask wallet, 
  React (Voting Ballot) and Node.js
